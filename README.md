## Bildgalleri

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is a working image gallery using Pexels API for images and stores them in localStorage when saved to the gallery.

## Running the project

First, an API-key has to be obtained from https://www.pexels.com by registering an account. Then create a .env-file and add the API-key in the following format:
PEXELS_API_KEY=your-api-key

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
